Static Rendering Concept 

-> In the latest next js version unlike server side rendering static rendering is also not supported 

-> But in static redering we use two methos getStaticProps and getStaticPath 

-> But here is the syntax of static redering 

Similar to server side redering
export const getStaticProps = (async (context) => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')
  const repo = await res.json()
  return { props: { repo } }
})
